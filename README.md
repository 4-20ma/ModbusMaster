## Overview
This is an Arduino library for communicating with Modbus slaves over RS232/485 (via RTU protocol).


## Features
The following Modbus functions are available:

Discrete Coils/Flags

  - 0x01 - Read Coils
  - 0x02 - Read Discrete Inputs
  - 0x05 - Write Single Coil
  - 0x0F - Write Multiple Coils

Registers

  - 0x03 - Read Holding Registers
  - 0x04 - Read Input Registers
  - 0x06 - Write Single Register
  - 0x10 - Write Multiple Registers
  - 0x16 - Mask Write Register
  - 0x17 - Read Write Multiple Registers

Both full-duplex and half-duplex RS232/485 transceivers are supported. Callback functions are provided to toggle Data Enable (DE) and Receiver Enable (/RE) pins.


## Installation

#### Library Manager
Install the library into your Arduino IDE using the Library Manager (available from IDE version 1.6.2). Open the IDE and click Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries&hellip;

Scroll or search for `ModbusMaster`, then select the version of the library you want to install. Quit/re-launch the IDE to refresh the list; new versions are automatically added to the list, once released on GitHub.

Refer to Arduino Tutorials > Libraries [Using the Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3).

#### Zip Library
Refer to Arduino Tutorials > Libraries [Importing a .zip Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4).

#### Manual
Refer to Arduino Tutorials > Libraries [Manual Installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5).


## Hardware
This library has been tested with an Arduino [Duemilanove](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove), PHOENIX CONTACT [nanoLine](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/online/portal/us?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a/usen/web/main/products/subcategory_pages/standard_logic_modules_p-21-03-03/3329dd38-7c6a-46e1-8260-b9208235d6fe/3329dd38-7c6a-46e1-8260-b9208235d6fe) controller, connected via RS485 using a Maxim [MAX488EPA](http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1111) transceiver.


## Caveats
Conforms to Arduino IDE 1.5 Library Specification v2.1 which requires Arduino IDE >= 1.5.

Arduinos prior to the Mega have one serial port which must be connected to USB (FTDI) for uploading sketches and to the RS232/485 device/network for running sketches. You will need to disconnect pin 0 (RX) while uploading sketches. After a successful upload, you can reconnect pin 0.


## Support
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/4-20ma/ModbusMaster/issues) for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests. Email requests will be politely redirected to the issue tracker so others may contribute to the discussion and requestors get a more timely response.


## Example
The library contains a few sketches that demonstrate use of the `ModbusMaster` library. You can find these in the [examples](https://github.com/4-20ma/ModbusMaster/tree/master/examples) folder.
