    applicable to newer devices, and was not implemented in the unit
    selected. It could also indicate that the server (or slave) is in the

    number and transfer length is invalid. For a controller with 100 
    registers, the ADU addresses the first register as 0, and the last one 
    as 99. If a request is submitted with a starting register address of 96 
    and a quantity of registers of 4, then this request will successfully 
    operate (address-wise at least) on registers 96, 97, 98, 99. If a 
    request is submitted with a starting register address of 96 and a 
    quantity of registers of 5, then this request will fail with Exception 
    Code 0x02 "Illegal Data Address" since it attempts to operate on 
    registers 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100, and there is no register with address

    incorrect. It specifically does NOT mean that a data item submitted for 
    storage in a register has a value outside the expectation of the
