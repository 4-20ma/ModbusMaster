INSTALL

Arduino 17 (or later):
  Determine the location of your sketchbook by selecting File > 
  Preferences from within the Arduino IDE. If you don't already have a 
  libraries folder within your sketchbook, create one and unzip the 
  archive there. See http://arduino.cc/blog/?p=313 for more information. 


Arduino 16 (or earlier):
  Download the zip file, extract and copy the ModbusMaster folder to 
  ARDUINO_HOME/hardware/libraries. If you are upgrading from a previous 
  version, be sure to delete ModbusMaster.o.
