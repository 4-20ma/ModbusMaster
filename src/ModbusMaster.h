    applicable to newer devices, and was not implemented in the unit
    selected. It could also indicate that the server (or slave) is in the
    wrong state to process a request of this type, for example because it is

    number and transfer length is invalid. For a controller with 100
    registers, the ADU addresses the first register as 0, and the last one
    as 99. If a request is submitted with a starting register address of 96
    and a quantity of registers of 4, then this request will successfully
    operate (address-wise at least) on registers 96, 97, 98, 99. If a
    request is submitted with a starting register address of 96 and a
    quantity of registers of 5, then this request will fail with Exception
    Code 0x02 "Illegal Data Address" since it attempts to operate on
    registers 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100, and there is no register with address

    incorrect. It specifically does NOT mean that a data item submitted for
    storage in a register has a value outside the expectation of the
    application program, since the MODBUS protocol is unaware of the
